My controller.html file controls my display.html file.
For the Team name row, the user can enter in the home team and the away team and then hit submit in order to update the display. Both update at once, so if one contains no value, the other will show up blank.
The possession buttons can be clicked to indicate either home (team 1) or away (team 2) possession.
The team scores can be entered in the same way as the team name.
The period buttons can be used to put a box around the number for whichever period the user wishes to select.
Time on Clock allows the user to enter in the amount of time that should be shown on the clock. Hitting submit for this will not change the pause/ play value, however. So if the clock is running and you say ten seconds, it will continue to run. If you're entering a new time for a period, you'll need to hit play for the clock to run again.
Run Clock allows the user to either stop or start the clock. The clock will not run past 0, it will just dispaly "Game Over", so if the clock has expired the user must enter a positive value to run it again.
Timeouts remaining allows a user to indicate that a team has from 0 to 3 timeouts remaining. Like the team name values, these must be changed together. The number of timeouts remaining will be highlighted blue on the display page.
Total Yards allows the user to enter in total Yards for each team in the same manner as Team Score. The graph showing the yards will not appear until some yards are entered, but then it will label the home and away graphs.
New play allows the user to enter a recent play that was made which will appear on the play ticker. The play ticker only shows the four most recent plays and will stop showing plays after there have been four new ones entered.
